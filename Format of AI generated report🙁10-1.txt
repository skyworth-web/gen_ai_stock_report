Some sites are paid so useer has to subscribe.. I can subscribe for our reports. Not sure we need API access from these sites.

Show URL for user about a researh/ Clickable Link: in case user wants to see original report. Summary in 1-2 paragrpahs (what was research about in case user doesn't go an read original link.). Total 3-4 pages. For now URL from any
