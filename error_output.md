### Press Release Summary

Title: Apple Inc. Reports Record Q1 2025 Financial Results

Date: January 30, 2025

Press Release Link: [Apple Investor Relations](https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx)

Summary:

Apple Inc. has announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, ending December 28, 2024, marking a significant milestone with record-breaking figures. The company reported a quarterly revenue of $124.3 billion, representing a 4% increase year-over-year. This achievement underscores Apple's robust performance amidst global economic challenges, highlighting its resilience and strategic prowess in navigating complex market dynamics.

The diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter stood at $2.40, reflecting a 10% increase from the previous year. This growth in EPS is indicative of Apple's effective cost management and operational efficiency, contributing to enhanced shareholder value. The net quarterly profit was reported at $36.3 billion, up from $33.9 billion in the same quarter last year, further emphasizing the company's strong financial health.

A significant contributor to Apple's record revenue was its services segment, which achieved an all-time high of $26.3 billion, marking a 14% year-over-year growth. This surge was driven by substantial growth in both developed and emerging markets, showcasing the increasing demand for Apple's ecosystem of services, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. The services segment's performance highlights Apple's successful diversification strategy, reducing its reliance on hardware sales and enhancing its recurring revenue streams.

Despite the overall positive financial performance, Apple's iPhone sales presented a mixed picture. While the iPhone revenue reached $69.1 billion, setting all-time records in several markets, it fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Notably, iPhone sales in China declined by 11.1%, reflecting the challenges Apple faces in this critical market. However, the iPhone 16 family showed stronger year-over-year performance in regions where Apple Intelligence was available, indicating potential areas for future growth and market penetration.

The Mac division experienced its best growth since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, contributing positively to the overall revenue. This growth can be attributed to the continued innovation and appeal of Apple's Mac lineup, which resonates well with both consumer and professional segments.

In contrast, the "other products" category, which includes wearables such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats, and Vision Pro, saw a 2% decline in sales, totaling $11.75 billion. This decline suggests a challenging comparison against previous product launches, such as the Apple Watch Ultra2. However, the Apple Watch install base reached a new all-time high, with over half of the customers being new to the product, indicating sustained interest and potential for future growth in this segment.

The iPad segment reported a revenue of $8.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and the latest iPad Air. The iPad install base also reached an all-time high, with over half of the customers being new to the product. This growth underscores the continued demand for Apple's tablet offerings, particularly in educational and professional settings.

CEO Tim Cook expressed his satisfaction with the company's performance, stating, "Today Apple is reporting our best quarter ever." This sentiment reflects the company's strategic focus on innovation, customer satisfaction, and market expansion, which have been pivotal in achieving these record results.

In conclusion, Apple's Q1 2025 financial results highlight the company's ability to deliver strong performance across its diverse product and service portfolio. While challenges remain, particularly in the iPhone segment and specific geographic markets, Apple's strategic initiatives and focus on innovation position it well for sustained growth. The company's continued investment in its services ecosystem and expansion into new product categories are likely to drive future success, reinforcing its leadership position in the global technology landscape.
